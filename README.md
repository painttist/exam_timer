# Exam Timer

See it [Live](https://painttist.com/ExamTimer/)

This is an exam timer inspired by being an IB student, sitting through final exams and still messed up timing partly because the timer was not the clearest.

It can be argued that students can just use their own watch, but I believe that through visualizing the time elapsed as well as putting information into hierarchies can greatly help students focus more on their exam while efficiently keeping track of their time.

## Features:

- Multiple Subjects on One Screen
- Individual Start Time for each subject
- Subject (SL/HL) Duration can be changed by clicking on the timeline, default to 60 min (SL) and 120 min (HL)
- Currently this is designed specificifically for IB Standard Level / Higher Level subjects, please feel free to post requests or contact the developer via email (painttist@gmail.com) for additional support on other exam settings
